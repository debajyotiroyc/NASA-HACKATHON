# NASA-HACKATHON
This was our team's official project for the NASA SpaceApp Challenge.

We have created a website which mainly focuses on the mistreatment that our Earth faces at the hands of us human beings. This was our attempt at exposing the causes which is leading to the depletion of natural resources of our planet and also come up with solutions to prohibit such acts and support and work towards building a pollution-free planet.
