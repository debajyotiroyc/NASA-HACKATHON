<h1>CONCERNS AND THEIR MEASURES REGARDING OUR PLANET</h1>
The Earth, our loving planet, where we all live. True to the sentiments expressed by the playwright, the gentle showers of earth’s mercy has nourished and nurtured the human and other animals and plant existence on this planet. <ins> But, now our Earth is in danger , now more than ever.</ins>

<p> The biggest enviornmental issues concerning our Earth at the present moment are: </p>
<ul> 
	<li>Deforestation</li>
	<li>Pollution</li>
	<li>Loss of Biodiversity</li>
	<li>Ozone Depletion</li>
</ul>
</div>


<div class="ct1">
    <h1> DEFORESTATION</h1>
    <p> Deforestation refers to the decrease in forest areas across the world that are lost for other uses such as agricultural croplands, urbanization or mining activities. Greatly              accelerated by human activities since 1960, deforestation has been negatively affecting natural ecosystems, biodiversity and the climate.</p>
    <p> The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage, biodiversity loss, and aridity. Deforestation causes extinction, changes to climatic             conditions, desertification, and displacement of populations, as observed by current conditions and in the past through the fossil record.</p>
    <p> The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in habitat damage, biodiversity loss, and aridity. According to the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 the            global average annual deforested land in the 2015–2020 demi-decade was 10 million hectares and the average annual forest area net loss in the 2000–2010 decade was 4.7 million                hectares.</p>

<div class="ct"> 
    <h1> POLLUTION </h1>
    <p> Pollution refers to the introduction of chemicals, particulates, and biological matter that can be harmful to humans, plants and animals and cause damage to the natural environment.
        Whereas some causes of pollution are entirely natural, others are the result of human impact. Actually, Environmental pollution is currently the biggest challenge facing the entire         world today.</p>
    <p> The major forms of pollution include: </p>
    <ul>
	<li > AIR POLLUTION </li>
	<p>  Air pollution is a mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both outside and indoors. Its effects can range from higher disease risks to rising              temperatures. Soot, smoke, mold, pollen, methane, and carbon dioxide are a just few examples of common pollutants.</p>
        <p>  The main causes of air pollution are :</p>
	<ol>
		<li> Vehicle exhaust fumes</li>
		<li> Burning of fossil fuels</li>
		<li> Microbial decaying process</li>
		<li> Industrial Emmisions</li>
		<li> Burning garbage wastes in the open</li>
		<li> Deforestation </li>
		<br></br>
	</ol>

	<li > WATER POLLUTION </li>
	<p> Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, usually as a result of human activities. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater.             Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. </p>   
	<p> The major causes of water pollution are: </p>

	<ol>
		<li> Toxic chemicals emission in ocean through rivers from industries.</li>
		<li> Land run-off</li>
		<li> Large scale oil spills</li>
		<li> Ocean Mining.</li>
		<li> Disposal of Radioactive wastes</li>u<li> Atmospheric Deposition</li>
		<br></br>
	</ol>

	<li > SOIL POLLUTION </li>
	<p> Soil pollution refers to the contamination of soil with anomalous concentrations of toxic substances. It is a serious environmental concern since it harbours many health             hazards. For example, exposure to soil containing high concentrations of benzene increases the risk of contracting leukaemia.</p>
	<p> The major causes of soil pollution are: </p>
	<ol>
		<li> Use of Pesticides and Insecticides </li>
		<li> Use of organic chlorinated toxins </li>
		<li> Use of inorganic fertlizers</li>
	</ol>
    </ul>

<div class="ct1">
    <h1> LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY </h1>
    <p> Biodiversity loss includes the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, as well as the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat, resulting in a loss of         biological diversity.</p>
    <p> In a UN report published in 2019, scientists warned that one million species - out of an estimated total of eight million - are threatened with extinction, many within decades. Some         researchers even consider we are in the middle of the sixth mass extinction event in Earth’s history. Earlier known mass extinctions wiped out between 60% and 95% of all species. It         takes millions of years for ecosystems to recover from such an event.</p>
    <p> The major factors which result in loss of biodiversity are: </p>
    <ol>
	<li> Habitat Destruction (e.g. deforestation, intensive mono-culture, urbanisation) </li>
	<li> Direct exploitation such as hunting and over-fishing </li>
	<li> Climate change </li>
	<li> Introduction of genetically modified organisms.</li>
	<li> Pollution </li>
	
    </ol>
    <p> With the loss of biodiversity we have no access to the natural services, which includes water, soil formation, and protection, pollution breakdown and absorption, climate stability         and recovery from natural disasters.</p>

<div class="ct">
	<h1>OZONE DEPLETION</h1>
	<p> Ozone depletion,is the gradual thinning of Earth’s ozone layer in the upper atmosphere caused by the release of chemical compounds containing gaseous chlorine or bromine from 	            industry and other human activities.</p>
	<p> Ozone depletion is a major environmental problem because it increases the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches Earth’s surface, which increases the rate of skin 	            cancer, eye cataracts, and genetic and immune system damage. </p>
	<p>The major causes of ozone depletion are:</p>
	<ol>
		<li> Chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs are the main cause of ozone layer depletion. These are released by solvents, spray aerosols, refrigerators, air-conditioners, etc.</li>
		<li> Researches say that the unregulated launching of rockets result in much more depletion of ozone layer than the CFCs do. If not controlled, this might result in a huge 		     loss of the ozone layer by the year 2050.</li>
		<li> The nitrogenous compounds such as NO2, NO, N2O are also highly responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>WHAT CAN WE DO TO SAVE OUR EARTH?</h1>
	<p> Our dear planet Earth is facing too many threats for our deeds. It is our responsibility to save our world and to give a healthy, greener habitat to our future generations.</p>
	<p> Some of the steps that we can take to maintain a sustainable enviornment in our planet are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Ensure a decrease in deforestation and promote afforestaion.</li>
		<li> Encourage the practice of using renewable sources of energy instead of fuel.</li>
		<li> Invest in energy efficient appliances. </li>
		<li> Support or join movements related to save Environment. Young people have the most at stake when it comes to climate change. All over the world, kids, teenagers and 		     young adults are taking matters into their hands in inspiring ways. Middle-aged and old adults should help them to grow their movement by joining and supporting them.                </li>
		<li> Get politically active and vote for leaders at all levels of government who takes Environment issues seriously.</li>
